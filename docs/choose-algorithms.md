# Optimization problems (Maximization / Minimization)

- usually have a minimum or maximum constraint
- possible many feasible solutions, but just 1 optimal solution
- Common Strategies:
  1. Greedy method: problem solved in stages
  2. Dynamic Programming: problems broken into minor problems
  3. Branch and Bound: useful on minimization problems
