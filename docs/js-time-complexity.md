# Mutator Methods

- push() -> 0(1)
- pop() -> 0(1)
- shift() -> 0(n)
- unshift() -> 0(n)
- splice() -> 0(n)
- sort() -> 0(n log(n))

# Accessor methods

- concat() -> 0(n)
- slice() -> 0(n)
- indexOf() -> 0(n)

# Iteration methods

- forEach() -> 0(n)
- map() -> 0(n)
- filter() -> 0(n)
- reduce() -> 0(n)

# Notes

- The ECMA specification does not specify a bounding complexity, as you already might know, and nor does that engine. Every JavaScript engine is free to implement its own functionality, as long as it is compatible with the Standard;
